STEP 1:
	add "au BufNewFile,BufRead *.cflow setf cflow" in u ~/.vimrc
	
STEP 2:
	move cflow.vim to ~/.vim/syntax



NOTICE:
	Regard cflow's output as a new language, so the file name suffix should be ".cflow"
	Just like "cflow -o xxx.cflow"

	had got almost all symbols in C89/C99 standard libs
	


SNAPSHOT:
	cyan	--	functions defined ourself
	purple	--	variables defined ourself
	red	--	system functions
	black	--	system symbols
	yellow	--	file name
	green	--	type keywords in C
	white	--	something else
	orange(fg) --	number
	orange(bg) --	recursive functions
	


Enjoy it
